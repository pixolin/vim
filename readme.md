# Personal Vim configuration

For me the main advantage of using Vim is it's speed.
To keep it fast, I sparely use plugins – just some
color scheme and basics such as autocompletion of 
brackets.

## Installation

Prior to installation of plugins, Vim-Plug needs to
get installed with …

```bash
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

Afterwards plugins can be installed in Vim by 
running command `:PlugInstall`.
